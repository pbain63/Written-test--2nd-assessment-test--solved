2nd Assessment Test – _ _ _ Position

This project was given as part of a written assessment test for the _ _ _ position.
Due to limited time during the test, I was unable to complete it. I have since finished the project and uploaded the completed version here.

Note: This version is designed only for laptop/desktop view.

This project is a personal reproduction of a coding assessment. It contains only self-written HTML and CSS, with no proprietary assets.
